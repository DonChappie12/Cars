      Subaru's biggest vehicle ever is the Ascent, a three-row family-oriented SUV.
      Introduced for the 2019 model year, the Ascent offers seating for up to eight passengers and diverse cargo capabilities.
      Like Subaru's best-known cars, it has a turbocharged engine and AWD.
      The Ascent focuses on safety, which is made even better with new standard features added for 2021.
